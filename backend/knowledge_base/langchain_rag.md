Create an agent
Core benefits
Build completely custom agents and applications powered by LLMs in under 10 lines of code, with integrations for
OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and more
.
LangChain provides a prebuilt agent architecture and model integrations to help you get started quickly and seamlessly incorporate LLMs into your agents and applications.
LangChain vs. LangGraph vs. Deep Agents
Start with
Deep Agents
for a “batteries-included” agent with features like automatic context compression, a virtual filesystem, and subagent-spawning. Deep Agents are built on LangChain
agents
which you can also use LangChain directly.
Use
LangGraph
, our low-level orchestration framework, for advanced needs combining deterministic and agentic workflows.

See the
Installation instructions
and
Quickstart guide
to get started building your own agents and applications with LangChain.
Use
LangSmith
to trace requests, debug agent behavior, and evaluate outputs. Set
LANGSMITH_TRACING=true
and your API key to get started.
​
Core benefits
Standard model interface
Different providers have unique APIs for interacting with models, including the format of responses. LangChain standardizes how you interact with models so that you can seamlessly swap providers and avoid lock-in.

Easy to use, highly flexible agent
LangChain’s agent abstraction is designed to be easy to get started with, letting you build a simple agent in under 10 lines of code. But it also provides enough flexibility to allow you to do all the context engineering your heart desires.
Learn more
Built on top of LangGraph
LangChain’s agents are built on top of LangGraph. This allows us to take advantage of LangGraph’s durable execution, human-in-the-loop support, persistence, and more.
Learn more
Debug with LangSmith
Gain deep visibility into complex agent behavior with visualization tools that trace execution paths, capture state transitions, and provide detailed runtime metrics.

Connect these docs
to Claude, VSCode, and more via MCP for real-time answers.
